# Introduction

My app is called Oddjobs and it is an application that allows people to find quick jobs on a smaller scale. This app gives people the opportunity to find small or quick jobs around them. We live in a tough society where a lot of people are struggling to make money. My goal with this app is to create an environment where people of all background can find jobs.
